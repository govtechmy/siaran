import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

To delete a press release, call the `<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>` endpoint using the `DELETE` method. Replace `<ID>` in the endpoint URL with the unique identifier of the press release you wish to delete.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.delete(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"}
    )
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Successful Response

Upon successful deletion, you will receive a `204 No Content` response indicating that the press release has been successfully removed and that there is no additional content to send in the response body.

**Example Response:**

```bash
