title: Pre-upload a New File
description: Obtain a pre-signed URL to pre-upload a file.
---

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";
import { InfoIcon } from "@govtechmy/myds-react/icon";

To obtain a pre-signed URL for pre-uploading a file, call the `<SERVER_URL>/webhook/pre-upload/<SESSION_ID>` endpoint using a `POST` request.

Replace `<SESSION_ID>` with an unique identifier to group your pre-uploaded files. The identifier will be used later to commit the files to a resource later.

<Callout

  icon={<InfoIcon className="size-5" />}
>
    Pre-uploading is useful when you want to upload a file for a resource (e.g. Press Release) that does not exist yet.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/pre-upload/<SESSION_ID>" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: aprplication/json" \
      -d '{
        "filename": "Merdeka_1957_tunku_abdul_rahman.jpg",
        "contentType": "image/jpeg"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.post(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/pre-upload/<SESSION_ID>",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        json={
            "filename": "Merdeka_1957_tunku_abdul_rahman.jpg",
            "contentType": "image/jpeg"
        }
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Successful Response

Upon success, you will receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON body containing the pre-signed URL.

**Example Response:**

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "<URL>"
}
```
The returned URL is a pre-signed URL. You need to use this URL to upload your file using a `PUT` request.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -i -X PUT "<URL>" \
      -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
      -T "path/to/file/Merdeka_1957_tunku_abdul_rahman.jpg"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    with open("path/to/file/Merdeka_1957_tunku_abdul_rahman.jpg", "rb") as file_data:
        response = requests.put(
          "<URL>",
          headers={"Content-Type": "image/jpeg"},
          data=file_data
        )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  **Please use the correct `Content-Type`**.<br/><br/>
  The storage provider requires the accurate `Content-Type` to identify the type of file you are uploading and store it correctly.
  For a comprehensive list of valid `Content-Type` values, you can refer to [IANA Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types).
