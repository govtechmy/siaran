    curl -X GET "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.get(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
        }
