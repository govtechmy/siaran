description: Delete all attachments associated with a specific press release by its ID.

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

To delete all attachments for a press release, call the `<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachments` endpoint using the `DELETE` method. Replace `<ID>` in the endpoint URL with the unique identifier of the press release whose attachments you wish to delete.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachments" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.delete(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachments",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"}
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Successful Response

Upon successful deletion, you will receive a `204 No Content` response indicating that all attachments for the press release have been successfully removed and that there is no additional content to send in the response body.

**Example Response:**

```bash
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## Error Responses

### Press Release Not Found

If a press release with the specified `<ID>` does not exist, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "not_found",
  "message": "Press release not found"
}
```

**Note:**

* Deleting the press release itself will also remove all associated attachments.
