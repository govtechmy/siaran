title: Upload Attachment
description: Obtain a pre-signed URL to upload an attachment file to a specific media release.
---

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";
import { InfoIcon } from "@govtechmy/myds-react/icon";

To obtain a pre-signed URL for uploading an attachment, call the `<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/upload` endpoint using a `POST` request.

Replace `<ID>` with the unique identifier of the media release to which you want to upload an attachment.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/upload" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filename": "attachment.pdf",
        "contentType": "application/pdf"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.post(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/upload",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        json={
            "filename": "attachment.pdf",
            "contentType": "application/pdf"
        }
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Successful Response

Upon success, you will receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON body containing the pre-signed URL.

**Example Response:**

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "<URL>"
}
```

The returned URL is a pre-signed URL. You need to use this URL to upload your attachment file using a `PUT` request.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -i -X PUT "<URL>" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/pdf" \
      -T "path/to/file/attachment.pdf"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    with open("path/to/file/attachment.pdf", "rb") as file_data:
        response = requests.put(
          "<URL>",
          headers={"Content-Type": "application/pdf"},
          data=file_data
        )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  **Please use the correct `Content-Type`**.<br/><br/>
  The storage provider requires the accurate `Content-Type` to identify the type of file you are uploading and store it correctly.
  For a comprehensive list of valid `Content-Type` values, you can refer to [IANA Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types).

## Error Responses

### Invalid Request Body

If the request body is invalid or required fields are missing, you will receive a `400 Bad Request` response.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "invalid_type",
      "expected": "string",
      "received": "undefined",
      "path": [
        "filename"
      ],
      "message": "Required"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Press Release Not Found

If a press release with the specified `<ID>` does not exist, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "invalid_press_release",
  "message": "Not Found: Invalid press release"
}
```

This indicates that you need to verify the provided `<ID>` and ensure that the media release exists.
