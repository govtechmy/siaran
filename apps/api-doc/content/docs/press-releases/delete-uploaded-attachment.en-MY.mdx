description: Delete an uploaded attachment from a specific press release.
---

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

To delete a specific attachment for a press release, call the `<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/<FILENAME>` endpoint using the `DELETE` method. Replace `<ID>` in the endpoint URL with the unique identifier of the press release and `<FILENAME>` with the name of the attachment file to be deleted.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/<FILENAME>" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.delete(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/<FILENAME>",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"}
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Successful Response

Upon successful deletion, you will receive a `204 No Content` response indicating that the attachment has been successfully removed and that there is no additional content in the response body.

**Example Response:**

```bash
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## Error Responses

### Press Release Not Found

If a press release with the specified `<ID>` does not exist, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "not_found",
  "message": "Press release not found"
}
```

### Attachment Not Found

If an attachment with the specified `<FILENAME>` does not exist for the press release, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.
