title: Complete Attachment Upload
description: Finalize the attachment upload process for a specific press release.
---

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";
import { InfoIcon } from "@govtechmy/myds-react/icon";

To complete the attachment upload for a press release, call the `<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/upload/complete` endpoint using a `POST` request. 

Replace `<ID>` with the unique identifier of the press release for which you are finalizing the upload.

<Callout
  type="info"
  icon={<InfoIcon className="size-5" />}
>
  **This operation is crucial for ensuring that the database correctly registers the uploaded attachments.**
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Python"]}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/upload/complete" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    response = requests.post(
        "<SERVER_URL>/webhook/press-releases/<ID>/attachment/upload/complete",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
        }
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Successful Response

Upon successful completion, you will receive a `204 No Content` response. This indicates that the server has successfully processed the request and finalized the attachment registration in the database. 

**Example Response:**

```bash
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## Error Responses

### Press Release Not Found

If a press release with the specified `<ID>` does not exist, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "not_found",
  "message": "Not Found"
}
```

This indicates that you should verify the provided `<ID>` and ensure that the press release exists before attempting to complete the attachment upload.
